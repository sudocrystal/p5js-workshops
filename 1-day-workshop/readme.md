This is a completely open and self-motivated project. We hope to encourage the students to take it in any direction they choose.
* Prompt: Create a complete project that represents who you are, your values, or something really important to youâ€”a self portrait
* Students should sketch extensively before starting, this will not only help them but it will also help the volunteers give assitance and help along the way
* Encourage studetns who work quickly to add interactions to their self portrait
* If students give permission, we would like to be able to share their creations outside of the classroom
