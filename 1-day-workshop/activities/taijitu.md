# Taijitu
_Optional activity_

## Goal
![Image of a Taijitu drawn with p5.js](images/taijitu.png)

Create a [Taijitu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taijitu). You are limited to using only one rectangle, and as many ellipses as you need.

## Functions to consider using
* `createCanvas`
* `background`
* `stroke`
* `noStroke`
* `fill`
* `noFill`
* `strokeWeight`

## Discussion questions
* How does the way in which you order the functions effect the output of your program?
* What did you find difficult about this activity? How were you able to overcome those difficulties?

## Extra Challenge
The Taijitu your wrote is probably static, add code that allows the taijitu to follow your mouse as you move it around the screen
