# Draw a face
_Activity 2_

## Goal
Draw a face using as many shape functions as you can. Each section of the face should be in its own function that you create (e.g., eyes, mouth, ears, etc). This can be the face of an adult human, a baby, an animal, a monster, a robot, or really anything you can imagine. We encourage you to sketch out your face on paper first, before starting to program. Hint: Keep your face simple, so you have enough time for the interactive robot activity.

## Functions to consider using
* `canvasSize`
* `ellipse`
* `rect`
* `line`
* `arc`
* `quad`
* `triangle`
* `bezier`
* `beginShape`
* `vertex`
* `endShape`
* `fill`
* `stroke`

## Programming constructs to consider using
* functions

## Discussion questions
* Ellipses and rects seem to draw from different points, why do you think this is? How are ellipses and rects different?

## Extra Challenge
The face you created is probably static, add code that allows the taijitu to follow your mouse as you move it around the screen.
