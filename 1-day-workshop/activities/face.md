# Draw a face
_Activity 2_

## Goal
Draw a face using as many shape functions as you can. This can be the face of an adult human, a baby, an animal, a monster, a robot, or really anything you can imagine. We encourage you to sketch out your face on paper first, before starting to program.

## Functions to consider using
* `canvasSize`
* `ellipse`
* `rect`
* `line`
* `arc`
* `quad`
* `triangle`
* `bezier`
* `beginShape`
* `vertex`
* `endShape`
