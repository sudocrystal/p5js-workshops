# Grid of stars
_Optional activity_

## Goal
Write code that draws a grid of stars that take up the entire canvas size. You should create a function for an individual star and then use loops within draw to produce the grid. Don't know how to use loops? Talk with your volunteer!

## Functions to consider using
* `canvasSize`
* `beginShape`
* `vertex`
* `endShape`
* `random`
* `fill`

## Variables to consider using
* `width`
* `height`

## Programming constructs to consider using
* functions
* parameters
* for loops

## Discussion questions
* Why do you think we encouraged you to use loops instead of writing code for each individual star?

## Extra Challenge
Update your code so that the stars all flash a random color.
