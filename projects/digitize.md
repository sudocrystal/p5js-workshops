# Digitize
_Transform an analog piece of art, into a digitial piece of art_

## Goal
Practice calling functions, passing arguments, and creating digital colors

## Part 1: Choose a piece of art
Locate a piece of art that inspires you, for this project it is best if you choose a painting or drawing with geometric like shapes. Explore the artwork folder, or some of the art books that we brought along, or if you want to challenge yourself, try and recreate a piece of art from your memory.

Decide either to reproduce the entire artwork or select a crop of the artwork (this is best for artworks with lots of details).

## Part 2: Make a Plan
Plan out what shapes you will use in p5.js to represent the shapes in the artwork, draw it out by hand so you have a guide to work from. You will also want to plan out the colors you plan to use.

We don't want you to direclty replicate the artwork, instead use it as inspiration to create a digital version.

## Part 3: Write the code
Write your static code (no draw function needed) in p5.js making sure to include comments as you go that explain your code. We highly recommend that you run your code often so you can discover errors along the way instead of waiting until the very end.

In most situations we expect you to use many different kinds of p5.js functions including but not limited to `line`, `triangle`, `quad`, `rect`, `ellipse`, `arc`, `stroke`, `fill`, and `background`.
