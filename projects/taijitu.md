# Taijitu
## Goal
Stretch your problem solving skills by programming a Taijitu.

## Task

![Image of a Taijitu drawn with p5.js](images/taijitu.png)

Create a Taijitu using p5.js similar to the one shown at right. You are limited to using only one rectangle, and as many ellipses as you need. Other commands you may want to use include: `createCanvas`, `background`, `stroke`, `noStroke`, `fill`, `noFill`, `strokeWeight`.

You may work together with others but make sure you fully understand your own solution.

## Extra Challenge
The Taijitu your wrote is probably static, using the robot exercise as a guide, add code that allows the taijitu to follow your mouse as you move it around the screen
